# Boundaries and appropriate behaviour

Clear boundaries help keep everyone safe.

Important points:
- adults and juniors should behave appropriately at all times
- private messages and contact should follow club guidance
- changing rooms and private spaces should be respected

If something feels wrong, it probably is.
