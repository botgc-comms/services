# Scoring words

Golf has quick words that tell you how a hole went **compared to par**.

**Par** is the number of strokes a good golfer is expected to take on that hole.  
So “par 4” means: *aim to take 4 shots*.

## The four words you’ll hear most

- **Birdie**: 1 under par  
- **Par**: exactly par  
- **Bogey**: 1 over par  
- **Eagle**: 2 under par  

## A simple way to explain it to a junior

Ask: “Was it **under**, **level**, or **over** par?”

Then translate it:

- Under by 1 → **birdie**
- Level → **par**
- Over by 1 → **bogey**
- Under by 2 → **eagle**

## Quick examples (do these out loud)

1) A hole is **par 3**. Your junior takes **4** shots.  
That’s **1 over** → **bogey**.

2) A hole is **par 5**. Your junior takes **4** shots.  
That’s **1 under** → **birdie**.

3) A hole is **par 4**. Your junior takes **2** shots.  
That’s **2 under** → **eagle**.
