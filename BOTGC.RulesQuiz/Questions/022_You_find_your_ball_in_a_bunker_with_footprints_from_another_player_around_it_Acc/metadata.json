      "id": "a",
      "text": "Yes, but only if the footprints are in the direct line of play."

      "text": "No, You will get 2 penalty strokes for improving the conditions affecting the stroke"
    }

  "explanation": "Players cannot touch or rake the sand in a bunker to improve their playing conditions before a shot. Doing so incurs a two-stroke penalty in stroke play or loss of hole in match play. This ensures the ball is played as it lies, preserving the integrity and challenge of the game.",
