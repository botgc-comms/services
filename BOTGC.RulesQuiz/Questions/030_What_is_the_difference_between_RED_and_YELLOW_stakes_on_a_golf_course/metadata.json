  "correctAnswer": null,
  "explanation": "Red and yellow stakes on a golf course mark special areas called penalty areas. If you want to take a drop Yellow stakes mean you have to drop your ball in a straight line behind the area where your ball went in. Red stakes give you more choices: you can drop your ball on either side of the area (called \"lateral relief\"), not just behind it. Think of yellow stakes like a straight path you have to follow, and red stakes like a crossroad where you can choose which way to go.",
