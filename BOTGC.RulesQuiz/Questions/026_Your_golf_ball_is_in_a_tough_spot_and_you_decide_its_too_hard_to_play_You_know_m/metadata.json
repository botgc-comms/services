  "explanation": "When your golf ball lands in a spot where you think it's too difficult to play, the rules give you options to move it, but each comes with a one-stroke penalty. You can go back and play from where you last hit the ball, which is called \"stroke and distance.\" Or, you can drop the ball in a straight line back from the tough spot, as far back as you want, keeping the line between the hole and where the ball originally was. Lastly, you have the option to drop the ball within two club-lengths of where it lay, but not nearer to the hole.",
