  "explanation": "If you believe another player has played your ball, you should stop play and inform the player as soon as possible. The rules of golf allow you to replace the ball with a similar one in the spot where yours is believed to have been. There is no penalty for either player in this situation, provided the mistake is rectified and both players agree on the ball's original position. This rule ensures fairness and maintains the pace of play.",
