  "explanation": "When you're unsure about a golf rule, you can play a second ball to keep the game fair. First, tell your playing partners what you're doing. Choose which ball you'd like to count, just in case the rules allow it. After the hole, get the right rule checked to see which ball's play was correct. This keeps the game honest and lets you learn the rules as you play.",
