  "correctAnswer": "a",
  "explanation": "Always mark your ball with something that is unique to you. If you need to check that the ball is yours then mark its position with something like a tee peg, and gently pick it up and check it. You are only allowed to clean it just enough to identify that it is yours. Then put it back. You might pick up a penalty shot if you don't follow this advice.",
