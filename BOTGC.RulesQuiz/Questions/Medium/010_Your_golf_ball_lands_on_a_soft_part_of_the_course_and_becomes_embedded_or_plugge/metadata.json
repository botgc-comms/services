  "correctAnswer": "a",
  "explanation": "When a ball becomes embedded in its own pitch mark on the fairway or in the rough, the rules of golf allow for free relief. This means you can mark the spot where the ball lay, lift and clean the ball, then drop it without penalty within one club-length of the nearest point of relief, but not nearer to the hole. This rule helps to address situations where the ball is unplayable due to course conditions.",
