  "correctAnswer": "a",
  "explanation": "\"Ground Under Repair\" (GUR) is a term used in golf for areas of the course that are being fixed or improved. If your ball lands in a GUR, you're allowed to move it to a better spot close by, without any penalty. This rule helps make sure you can still enjoy your game, even if parts of the course are under repair.",
