  "question": "You are in a match-play competition and have just won the last hole, but now you have a difficult tee shot coming up because on the next hole you have to get over a large lake! Your opponent tees up first and hits an amazing shot straight over the lake into the middle of the fairway. Which of these is true?*",

  "correctAnswer": "a",
  "explanation": "In match-play, you and your opponent should only play when it is your turn. This is because the outcome of your shot might affect how your opponent chooses to play theirs! In this case, you are well within your rights to ask your opponent to take their shot again after you have hit your tee shot. They do not get a penalty, but they might not be as lucky with their second tee-shot. If they had hit a terrible first shot, and you think that gives you the advantage then you can simply play on.",
