  "correctAnswer": "a",
  "explanation": "Under the Rules of Golf, a player is not allowed to break anything growing or fixed (like branches or grass) to improve the area of their intended stance, swing, or ball’s line of play. Bending a branch during your stance or swing is considered to improve your line of play and is against the rules. The player must either play the ball as it lies or decide to take a penalty for an unplayable lie.",
