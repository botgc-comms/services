  "correctAnswer": "a",
  "explanation": "A, B, and C are all things you can do if your ball is in a place where you can't or don't want to play it. You say it's 'unplayable,' and then you can move the ball, but you always have to add one extra stroke to your score as a penalty for moving it. You can drop it within 2 club lengths no nearer the hole, go back as far as you want or play it from where you last hit it. Each time you MUST drop it from knee height.",
