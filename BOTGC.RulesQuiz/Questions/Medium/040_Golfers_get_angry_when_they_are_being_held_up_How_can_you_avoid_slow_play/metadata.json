  "correctAnswer": "a",
  "explanation": "All are correct. \"Calling someone through\" allows the group behind you to take the lead and can be a good idea if you are having to look for a lost ball. Also, if you have taken so many shots that you can no longer score then give up and move to the next hole. But remember, if you are in a match-play competition you must tee off in the correct sequence, otherwise you can just go when you are ready.",
