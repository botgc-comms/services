  "correctAnswer": "a",
  "explanation": "In golf, you have to let the ball move into the hole on its own. If your ball stops right next to the hole, you might really want it to fall in, but you can't blow on it or touch it to help it along. If someone does that, they've broken a golf rule and will get an extra two penalty shots added to their score. And it's never ok to mess around on a golf course, it can be dangerous, and risks damaging the course for others.",
